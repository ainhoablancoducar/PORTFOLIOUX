                        danger.
                        The alert stays asleep until the moment the smartwatch detects a sudden change on the user’s

                        collected through her michrophone which helps them take action faster than the usual emergency

                        Have you ever felt it takes ages to choose a movie on Netflix? Does it take forever
                        when you’re choosing with your friends?
                        Exactly, that’s the reason why we have created a new feature for Netflix which combines
                        a short quizz each of your friends must take, and a game of roulette to offer you a
                        movie or TV series adapted to your current whims.
                        The feature has been designed for smartphone although it could quickly be adapted to
                        a desktop or TV screen.

                    <p>Comercial Pazos is a woodwork hardware store near Madrid city centre. It has been suplying it’s
                        loyal costumers with goods and tools since the 1950’s and since the early 2000’s it’s products
                        can
                        also be purchased via website.
                        It isn’t a user centered designed website, though, which causes many trouble to the customers,
                        who
                        usually end up going to the physical shop.
                        Me, together with an awesome team of designers, have re-designed Pazos’ website, providing it
                        with
                        an
                        intuitive and simple organization of the products, as well as a more visual and modern
                        interface.

                <h2>
                    Why does an actor become a designer?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having performed for over a decade, I can say I am deeply in love with theatre. But hey, design is
                    my
                    second child, I could never pick just one ;)
                    But what is my comeback about performing? when I perform I get to empathize with a character so that
                    I
                    can really, deeply understand its needs and urges; I also get to make up incredibly powerful and
                    colourful stories; and also, I get to perform in front of tens, hundreds of thousands of people and
                    move
                    them with my character’s story. I know how to read the room and adapt the story to the live
                    audience. It
                    never gets boring.
                    UX design, on the other hand allows me to focus on the problem and play with it, understand it so
                    deep I
                    can start building solutions. It allows me to iterate, which -basically means fail over and over so
                    that
                    I don’t take the first solution for granted-, no, I get to work and keep trying until a real,
                    plausible
                    solution comes. It also helps me organize my ideas so that I don’t get lost in the way - believe me,
                    a
                    creative mind needs some scaffolding to sustain it.
                    Also, I get to make beautiful and harmonic creations which help users enjoy their experience on the
                    site.
